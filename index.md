# Community for MIT during COVID-19

# Discord

We're creating a campus-wide Discord server to serve as a central hub for social interaction while off-campus and to be a launching-off point for other events. Please join, even if you're not usually into social media!

  1. Visit https://discord.gg/a6SHCkC and create a Discord account if you don't have one.
  2. Email [busy-beavers@mit.edu](mailto:busy-beavers@mit.edu) from your MIT email address with your Discord username and ask to join.
  3. We'll approve you as soon as possible.
